# Recipe-Calculator
Browser app to scale ingredients in recipes to fit your needs!

This is a small application written with Javascript, HTML, and css that will run in a browser window.

I find myself regularly looking at recipes and thinking that it will make too much food for my small family of three! Or even thinking that I will need much more food so that I can bring enough for holiday gatherings! Maybe this is something you have to deal with too, trying to divide 1/4 tsp of salt by 3/4 to make a slightly smaller meal for instance...

With this application you will be able to input all of the ingedients for a recipe you have and then choose to cut the entire recipe down by 1/4, 1/2, or 3/4, or to scale it up double, triple, etc., whatever you need. In doing so it will adjust the amount of each individual ingredient keeping all of the proportions.
